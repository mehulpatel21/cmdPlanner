#Command line bash organizer

A simple bash script command line planner, mainly for fun. Built and used on android devices. Designed for portability, GNU and non-GNU platforms, and uses utilities which are standard to all distros, including the limited range of utils on the Android platform.

Feel free to use, revise, or comment on any part of the script.
